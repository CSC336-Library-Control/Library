# Library Control
This is a project for class CSC 33600, the topic of our team is Online Library.

### Database:

We use MariaDB as our database support.

You need to download the MariaDB and then run the file "Library.sql" to create the database and insert the data.

### Backend:

Backend we use python language, and having Flask framework run on python's virtual environment.

All the python code is on the `demoSever.py` file.

Before running this file, your machine should have the `mariadb`, `json`, `flask`, and `flask_cors` packages installed.

To run the back, just simply locate to the directory which `demoSever.py` is at in the terminal, and use `python demoSever.py` to have the server running.
